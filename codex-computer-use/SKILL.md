# Codex Computer Use

## Purpose

Use the Codex.app bundled CLI as a Computer Use bridge for another coding agent. The goal is to let an agent that can run shell commands delegate GUI work to `codex exec`, instead of depending on native Computer Use support in that agent.

Use this pattern:

```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only --ephemeral --skip-git-repo-check -C "$PWD" "PROMPT"
```

## Install This Skill

Install from this skills repository:

```bash
npx skills add schroneko/skills -g -a claude-code -a codex -s codex-computer-use -y
```

Use the equivalent agent selection flags for other skill managers if they support Agent Skills.

## Preconditions

Installing this skill is not enough by itself. The host machine also needs Codex.app's Computer Use plugin, the Codex.app bundled CLI, and per-app Computer Use approval.

Check these before diagnosing Computer Use failures:

```bash
which codex
codex --version
codex mcp list
```

When running from Claude Code, also confirm:

```bash
which claude
claude --version
```

Expected:

- `codex` should be the Codex.app bundled CLI. On macOS app installs, it is often available under `/Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex`
- `claude` should run if the caller is Claude Code
- `codex mcp list` should include `computer-use`
- Target apps must be installed and running before `get_app_state`

If `which codex` points to a CLI that is not bundled with Codex.app and Computer Use fails with Apple Event authentication errors, prefer the Codex.app bundled CLI.

If a Homebrew-installed `codex` is shadowing the Codex.app bundled CLI, one possible fix is to remove the cask and put the bundled binary on `PATH`:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask codex
ln -s /Applications/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex /opt/homebrew/bin/codex
```

Only do this after confirming both conditions:

- The machine installed `codex` through Homebrew.
- The user wants the Codex.app bundled CLI to own `codex`.

## First-Time Setup

1. Install and open Codex.app.
2. Confirm `codex mcp list` shows `computer-use`.
3. Confirm the target app exists and has a bundle identifier:

```bash
mdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier -raw /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app
```

4. Approve the app for Computer Use, either interactively or by editing the approval JSON after user consent.
5. Start the target app before running `codex exec`.
6. Run a read-only `get_app_state` smoke test before clicking or typing.

The app approval file usually lives under the user's home directory:

```text
~/Library/Group Containers/2DC432GLL2.com.openai.sky.CUAService/Library/Application Support/Software/ComputerUseAppApprovals.json
```

Expected shape:

```json
{
  "approvedBundleIdentifiers": [
    "com.google.Chrome",
    "com.apple.Safari",
    "com.apple.finder"
  ]
}
```

## Agent Usage

Invoke Computer Use through `codex exec` from the calling agent's shell tool. Keep the prompt explicit and constrained. Claude Code can use this skill directly, but the same bridge pattern also works from any agent that can run `codex exec`.

Read-only app inspection:

```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only --ephemeral --skip-git-repo-check -C "$PWD" \
  "Do not run shell commands. Use computer-use MCP only. Call get_app_state for Google Chrome exactly once. Do not click, type, scroll, drag, press keys, or switch apps. Report only whether the call succeeded or failed and the exact error if it failed."
```

Single click:

```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only --ephemeral --skip-git-repo-check -C "$PWD" \
  "Do not run shell commands. Use computer-use MCP only. In Safari, inspect the visible page. Click the visible Increment button exactly once. Do not navigate away, do not interact with browser chrome controls, extensions, account UI, or other tabs. Report whether it succeeded."
```

Single input:

```bash
codex exec --sandbox read-only --ephemeral --skip-git-repo-check -C "$PWD" \
  "Do not run shell commands. Use computer-use MCP only. In Safari, inspect the visible page. Set the visible text input to 'hello-codex'. Do not submit forms, navigate away, or interact with other tabs. Report whether it succeeded."
```

Use `--sandbox read-only` to protect files. Remember that it does not make GUI clicks or typing read-only; the prompt must constrain GUI behavior.

## Browser Choice

Prefer Chrome when it is installed and visible to LaunchServices:

```bash
ls -ld /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app
mdls -name kMDItemCFBundleIdentifier -raw /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app
open -a "Google Chrome"
```

Fallback to Safari when Chrome is missing, being reinstalled, or returns `appNotFound`:

```bash
open -a Safari
```

Browser Use is separate from Computer Use. If `browser-use` is not shown by `codex mcp list`, use Computer Use for Chrome/Safari GUI operations.

## Approvals

`codex exec` cannot answer Computer Use approval elicitation interactively. If a target app is not approved, one of these errors can appear:

```text
Computer Use approval denied via MCP elicitation for app '...'
```

Fix by either:

- Run interactive `codex`, request a harmless `get_app_state` for the target app, and choose `Always allow`
- Add the target bundle identifier to `ComputerUseAppApprovals.json` when the user has approved broad app access

Common bundle identifier examples:

```text
com.apple.Safari
com.apple.finder
com.google.Chrome
```

## Failure Handling

For `Apple event error -10000: Sender process is not authenticated`, verify that `codex` points to the Codex.app bundled CLI. Homebrew-only CLI can see tools but fail Apple Events.

For `appNotFound("Google Chrome")`, check whether Chrome is installed, currently being reinstalled, or not running. Start it and retry.

For sensitive pages, avoid quoting page text, URLs, filenames, account data, or UI tree details. Ask Codex to report only success/failure and exact errors.

## Safe Prompt Rules

Always specify:

- Target app name
- Target page or window when known
- Allowed tool family: `computer-use MCP only`
- Forbidden actions: no shell commands, no navigation, no other tabs, no account UI
- Exact action count: click once, type one value, inspect once
- Reporting limits: no private page contents or UI tree dumps

Use a local throwaway page for destructive or uncertain tests before touching real pages.
